#Step by Step
#1. Download CSV file with the similarity (Free to choose. Ex: 80%, 90%, etc) first
#2. Copy and Paste all the CID code with note
#3. Put the file in any directory (ex: C\User\name\document\CID code txt file)
#4. Run the code below with input the directory of CID txt file
#5. The work is done, if you want to change the directory output. You can see the notes on output_directory, change to whatever you like
